**Smart Home Automation**

Automation is the technique or system of controlling a process by electronics devices with reducing human efforts and human involvement. This aim of this project is to design a model whisch is efficient in  monitoring and controlling Home Automation system consists from an android application based on Arduino. This system uses Wi-Fi technology as communication protocol to connect system components. The proposed system consist of two main components; the first part is android application that can give orders to units that one wishes to control by locally or remotely and second part is Arduino that has appropriate interface to sensors and appliances of Home Automation system and communicate with an Android application through wireless technology. The automation system can have a vital role in reducing the total energy consumed by home appliances. The main objective of Home Automation is to help handicapped and old aged people who will enable themselves in controlling home appliances and one more benefit of this project is we can get current status of home appliances from at any location.

**What is Home Automation?**

**Basic idea of home automation is :-**
Home automation gives you access to control devices in your home from a mobile device anywhere in the world. The term may be used for isolated programmable devices, like thermostats
and sprinkler systems, but home automation more accurately describes homes in which nearly everything — lights, appliances, electrical outlets, heating and cooling systems — are hooked up to a remotely controllable network. From a home security perspective, this also includes your alarm system, and all of the doors, windows, locks, smoke detectors, surveillance cameras and any other sensors that are linked to it. Typically involving only lighting, heating and cooling systems, building automation rarely provided more than basic control, monitoring and scheduling functions and was accessible only from specific control points within the building itself. Automation is, unsurprisingly, one of the two main characteristics of home automation. Automation refers to the ability to program and schedule events for the devices on the network. The programming may include time-related commands, such as having your lights turn on or off at specific times each day. It can also include non-scheduled events, such as turning on all the lights in your home when your security system alarm is triggered.

**Remote control section**

The other main characteristic of cutting-edge home automation is remote monitoring and access. While a limited amount of one-way remote monitoring has been possible for some The other main characteristic of cutting-edge home automation is remote monitoring and access. While a limited amount of one-way remote monitoring has been possible for some time, it’s only since the rise in smartphones and tablets that we’ve had the ability to truly connect to our home networks while we’re away. With the right home automation system, you can use any Internet-connected device to view and control the system itself and any attached devices. Monitoring apps can provide a wealth of information about your home, from the status of the current moment to a detailed history of what has happened up to now. You can check your security system’s status, whether the lights are on, whether the doors are locked, what the current temperature of your home is and much more. With cameras as part of your home automation system, you can even pull up real-time video feeds and literally see what’s going on in your home while you’re away.
Even simple notifications can be used to perform many important tasks. You can program your system to send you a text message or email whenever your security system registers a potential problem, from severe weather alerts to motion detector warnings to fire alarms. You can also get notified for more mundane events, such as programming your “smart” front door lock to let you know when your child returns home from school. The real hands-on control comes in when you start interacting with the home automation system from your remote app. In addition to arming and disarming your security system, you can reprogram the scheduling, lock and unlock doors, reset the thermostat and adjust the lights all from your phone, from anywhere in the world. As manufacturers are creating more and more “smart” devices and appliances all the time, the possibilities for home automation are virtually limitless. You can make your smart phone as remote through an app file, just by sending your bits data one by one to Cloud and read that data through Controller may Arduino Uno, PIC, etc.

**Working**

The given block diagram consist of different blocks, but practically just 3blocks are there that’s are Remote controlling, Communication section and Devices working at home section.
If we want to build the home automation system at home it require to know about how all devices of are working actually and to control them through relay and by other devices like thyristors, etc. First we have to connect our controller with Internet by using Wi-Fi modules like ESP8266 and using cloud method our free Google Firebase system you can store your own programmed data base on it one by one like Lamp1, Lamp2, etc. Note the specific host name and secret key and mentioned in the controller program for authentication purpose. Then using some online app inventer method, create your own app file according to as you want to suitable, also mention in the app file which database you are using means mention the host name and secret code here also.
Finally after making an app, program your Arduino as per your devices are connected to controller by reading and writing operation. Then connecting home appliances to controller through relay, you can control them by your mobile app. You can also make improvement in it like connecting different sensors and actuators. The home automation basic block diagram is as given bellow:

**Applications**

**Smart Home Appliances for Physically Challenged Individuals:**
If an individual has difficulty moving around effectively, they are often forced to depend on others for care. With the implementation of smart home appliances, such as an effective security system, those with physical challenges are often able to live on their own. A smart home security system allows the homeowner to remotely view visitors on a camera, and
speak to them via microphone and speakers. If the visitor is welcome, the security system unlocks and opens the door to allow the visitor access to the home. Smart home security systems can also learn which visitors are always allowed, and what areas they may have access to.

**Home robots and security:**
A household security system integrated with a home automation system can provide additional services such as remote surveillance of security cameras over the Internet, or access control and central locking of all perimeter doors and windows.

**Air quality control:**
For example, Air Quality Egg is used by people at home to monitor the air quality and pollution level in the city and create a pollution map.

**Conclusion**
People who are elderly or disabled benefit the most SmartHomeUSA.com "What is a Smart from a home automation system.
The opportunity to be independent, rather than staying in an assisted living facility. Designing a Smart Home is also very crucial. This can be tough; putting together a home design that reflects your taste, yet also fits your needs and budget is a balancing act that takes planning. In short our paper of Home automation basically consist of controlling of Home appliances though our smart phone from any corner of the world over through internet. As home appliances which are connected to Wi-Fi home router can be controlled through our smart phone data from any corner of the world without any distance barrier.
